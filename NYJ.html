    <h1> Born A Crime</h1>
  
  <p>  Born a Crime is a South African-inspired book written by Trevor Noah. The Title Born a Crime is drawn to the fact that  <br>he was born to a white father and black mother which was illegal under apartheid laws.<br> The main theme discussed in chapter one is racial discrimination and the challenges of people who come <br>from mixed races are also experienced in Nairobi.<br> <br> <br> <b> Education and Job Opportunities</b> <br> Nairobi, just like South Africa experiences instances where one has job opportunities and education opportunities  as a result <br>of how they look.<br> White people are given priority in some restaurants. They are also served the best food and the rest of the food is served to blacks. <br> <br>Moreover, Trevor Noah's search for identity and looking for a sense of belonging is similar to that of Kenya<br> because Kenya is home to many ethnic groups. Each ethnic group has its own culture that is unique and with a different history.<br> Trevor Noah's search for identity is similar to many people who struggle to fit in and <br>search for their origin.
    Various people lose job opportunities because they come from specific ethnic groups.<br>Trevor Noah's mother was given the lowest-ranked job in the office because she was black and the whites were <br>given nice and high-paying jobs.<br> <br> <br>In conclusion, the theme of discrimination based on ethnicity and education is prevalent in Kenya and is similar <br>to that of South Africa whereby the whites had taken the country and had total control over the people.<br> The whites used to receive the best education and also get the best jobs leaving the Africans with nothing but the <br>bare minimum. Nairobi and South Africa face similar social issues and are all trying to equalize everyone.
