    <h1> Born A Crime</h1>
    <h2> Author: Trevor Noah</h2>
    <h3> Chapter 1&2 summary</h3>
  <p>  Born a Crime is a South African-inspired book written by Trevor Noah. The Title Born a Crime is drawn to the fact that  <br>he was born to a white father and black mother which was illegal under apartheid laws.<br> The main theme discussed in chapter one is racial discrimination and the challenges of people who come <br>from mixed races are also experienced in Nairobi.<br> Nairobi, just like South Africa experiences instances where one has job opportunities and education opportunities as a result of how they look.<br> white people are given priority in some restaurants. They are also served the best food and the rest of the food is served to blacks. Moreover, Trevor Noah's search for identity and looking for a sense of belonging is similar to that of Kenya because Kenya is home to many ethnic groups.<br> Each ethnic group has its own culture that is unique and with a different history. Trevor Noah's search for identity is similar to many people who struggle to fit in and search for their origin. <br>
    Various people lose job opportunities because they come from specific ethnic groups. Some people are given hard and low-paying <br>jobs based on their ethnic community. Trevor Noah's mother was given the lowest-ranked job in the office because she was black and the whites were given nice and high-paying jobs.<br>
     Trevor Noah was determined to get a high-quality education to overcome adversity. In Nairobi, education is being embraced and encouraged because it is one of the ways to overcome adversity. Education helps everyone be leveled up because the whites used to look down upon us. After all, we did not have education but once we acquire education, then we can be able to compete for job opportunities and education opportunities with the whites. <br> <br>In conclusion, the theme of discrimination based on ethnicity and education is prevalent in Kenya and is similar to that of South Africa whereby the whites had taken the country and had total control over the people. The whites used to receive the best education and also get the best jobs leaving the Africans with nothing but the bare minimum. Kenya also experiences issues similar to those in South Africa where people from specific ethnic groups are favored. The whites are also given the upper hand when it comes to receiving services and Kenya is still working towards treating everyone equally.
